The camera used is the Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 Wide with sensor size 4608-2592 pixels. With Diagonal field of view of 120 degrees giving a field in frame of 102 degrees horizontal and 67 degrees vertical. https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/camera-module-3/
With the two angles (Hor and vert) derived with P1 it is possible to give a ratio between the angles of the camera and the derived angles to find a "focal point" on the 2d plane on the photo.
  Because we use the farfield principle it is possible to place the angle in the centre of the camera from where the depth angles are also determined.

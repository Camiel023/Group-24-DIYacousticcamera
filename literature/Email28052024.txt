Dear students,
your project on a 'DIY Acoustic Camera' starts next week. 
The experimental work for the project will be in the DLab/Makerspace in the big hall of the D-building.
To get access to that space your student card needs to be activated.
To be able to activate your card, I will need your name, studentnumber and the number on your card.
 
From the coordinator I got your email addresses @student.uva.nl:
atom.levinson
camiel.van.der.marel
sam.moerdijk.moerdijk
jasper.nierse

Below you will find a short description of the project with some links as a starter.
See you next week.
Regards,
Rudolf Sprik

Do It Yourself Acoustic Camera
==============================
An acoustic camera can record sound using an array of microphones and overlap the sound sources with a visual image to show where it is coming from. The recordings from the microphone array are analyzed by using the physics of wave propagation. 

In this project a Do-It-Yourself acoustic camera is made based on a 4x4 array of microphones (UMA-16 from MiniDSP) and a Raspberry Pi. The hardware is available as well as python notebooks to get you started.
After the intro you can use your camera to do your own experiment. 
For example detect hissing sounds to make a leak detector.

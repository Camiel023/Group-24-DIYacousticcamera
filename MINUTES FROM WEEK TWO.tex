\hline
Date/Time/Place & 07/06/24, 11.00-17.30 \\ \hline
What            & Writing Python code for the mic array \\ \hline
Who             & CM \\ \hline
How             & First a script on paper to determine how it will work. Then writing it out in Python \\ \hline
What's next     & I found that the room I am working has to much background noise. We need to test the code in a quit room. \\ \hline

What            &  Testing of code\\ \hline
Who             &  AL, CM, SM, JN\\ \hline
How             &  By testing the code for the acoustic camera in a room with little background noise we tried to determine if the code would work. We found that during the first few test runs the camera picked up a lot of background noise and by reducing the noise we found that the code written by CM functioned. The test setupp was determined on location and no data obtained during testing will be used further. \\ \hline
What's next     &  The code for the mics doesn't work as it should and more coding by CM and AL is needed\\ \hline

How             &  Creating a structure for the minutes in Latex and linking this to GitHub\\ \hline
What's next     &  Making sure that everyone fills in this file so we have a complete picture of what we have done together with the GitHub Planning To Do list.\\ \hline

What            &  Studying literature on the triangle \\ \hline
Who             &  SM\\ \hline
How             &  With literature (Github: literature, Triangle.zip) added to Github by Sprik, I tried to educate myself more about the triangle and its sound behavior.\\ \hline
What's next     &   Error propagation. And eventually, collect data from testing and analyze them to understand noise behavior.\\ \hline

What            &  Error propagation\\ \hline
Who             &  SM\\ \hline
How             &   To calculate the error propagation, I use the partial derivatives of theta to the variables. Then I multiply the partial derivative of theta to a variable by the change in that variable and square it: $$\frac{\partial\theta}{\partial \text{variable}}\cdot\Delta\text{variable}$$ I do this for all variables and then finally take the root of the sum of these squared terms.\\ \hline

Who             &  JN\\ \hline
How             &  By looking up the specs on the Raspberry Pi website and making small sketches of the situation it was possible to find a way to implement the found angles with the microphones code and a picture taken with the camera on the array. \\ \hline
What's next     &  Writing some code to actually implement the camera to the existing code written by AL and CM.\\ \hline
